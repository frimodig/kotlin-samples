# kotlin-samples

##### Some sample classes written in Java and Kotlin to show Kotlin features

This repository exists to provide some examples of code usage for a presentation on Kotlin, without the exposing any
product code. The code within is meant purely as examples, It is definitely not a best practise example and you should
not copy anything from this code into your own projects.

The code has some comments to help you understand it, but mainly it is meant to function as and aide to the accompanying
presentation and going through it on its own is relatively pointless unless you are checking back on something after
attending the presentation.

*TL;DR Don't copy this code, it isn't meant to be used*
